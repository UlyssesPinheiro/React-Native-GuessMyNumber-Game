# About the game
Guess my number was a project developed during the course "React Native - The Practical Guide [2022]", from Udemy. 
The game is about your smartphone trying to guess a number you imagined. It will guess a random number, between 1-99 and you tell it if that was lower or higher than the number you thought about. Eventually, it will guess the right number, and show how many attempts took to get it right.

## Built with
- React Native
- Expo
